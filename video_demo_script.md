# Synapse: Video Pitch Script (60 Seconds)

**Goal**: Show "Tactile AI Control".
**Setup**:
1.  Open `functions/brain/main.py` (The Server) in one terminal.
2.  Open `functions/brain/sim_client.py` (The Simulator) in another terminal.
3.  Have some broken code in your clipboard (e.g., `def foo(x) return x + 1` <- syntax error).

## Scene 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:10)
**Visual**: Close up of you holding the MX Creative Console (or just the screen showing the code).
**Audio**: "Interacting with AI today is too slow. Chat boxes kill your flow. I built Synapse to conduct AI like a symphony."

## Scene 2: The Problem (0:10 - 0:20)
**Visual**: Show a screen with broken code. Highlight the error.
**Audio**: "When I'm coding and hit a bug, I don't want to alt-tab and copy-paste."

## Scene 3: The Solution - "The Fixer" (0:20 - 0:40)
**Visual**:
1.  **Action**: Press a button on your MX Console (or type `k 1` in the simulator).
2.  **Screen**: Show the terminal outputting "Fixing code..." and then the code instantly changing (or paste the fix).
**Audio**: "With Synapse, I just press the 'Fix' key. The agent reads my clipboard, debugs the code, and pastes the solution instantly."

## Scene 4: The Novelty - "Dial Tuning" (0:40 - 0:50)
**Visual**:
1.  **Action**: Turn the Dial (or type `d 80` in simulator).
2.  **Screen**: Show the 'Temperature' value rising in the terminal.
**Audio**: "And if I need more creativity? I just turn the dial. Left for precision, right for hallucination. It's tactile control for LLM parameters."

## Scene 5: Outro (0:50 - 1:00)
**Visual**: Logo of Synapse or your face.
**Audio**: "Synapse. Don't just chat with AI—conduct it. Built for the Logitech MX Creative Console."
