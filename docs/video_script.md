# PhysioInk: Video Pitch Script (60 Seconds)

**Goal**: Show "Precision Medical Training in MR"
**Format**: Talking head + concept slides/mockups + voiceover

---

## Scene 1: The Hook (0:00 – 0:08)
**Visual**: Close-up of a hand holding the MX Ink stylus, or a dramatic medical image.
**Audio**: "What if you could practice surgery anywhere, anytime — with nothing but a headset and a pen?"

## Scene 2: The Problem (0:08 – 0:18)
**Visual**: Show images of expensive cadaver labs, crowded lecture halls, flat textbook diagrams.
**Audio**: "Medical students need hands-on anatomy practice. But cadaver labs cost tens of thousands, and VR apps use clumsy hand controllers. That's not how surgeons work."

## Scene 3: The Solution (0:18 – 0:35)
**Visual**: PhysioInk concept art — show MX Ink being used as a scalpel on a 3D anatomical model in MR.
**Audio**: "PhysioInk turns the Logitech MX Ink into a virtual scalpel. Press lightly to cut through skin. Press harder for muscle. Feel the tissue resist through haptic feedback. Annotate in 3D. Trace on your desk. This isn't a toy — it's a training instrument."

## Scene 4: The MX Ink Magic (0:35 – 0:45)
**Visual**: Bullet points or animation showing the MX Ink features being used.
**Audio**: "We use every capability of the MX Ink — pressure sensitivity for incision depth, six degrees of freedom for spatial annotation, haptic feedback for tissue simulation, and surface mode for 2D-to-3D learning."

## Scene 5: The Impact (0:45 – 0:52)
**Visual**: Globe graphic or students in different locations.
**Audio**: "PhysioInk could replace a ten-thousand-dollar cadaver lab with a four-hundred-dollar headset and a stylus. Anatomy education, accessible to everyone."

## Scene 6: Outro (0:52 – 1:00)
**Visual**: PhysioInk logo + tagline.
**Audio**: "PhysioInk. Learn anatomy by touching it. Built for Logitech MX Ink and Meta Quest."
